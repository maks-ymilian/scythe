# Scythe
Scythe is a programming language that compiles to [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/)'s JSFX.

JSFX is used for writing audio effects in the digital audio workstation [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/).
It makes developing audio effects and instruments fast and immediate.

Scythe uses C-like syntax and aims to make writing JSFX plugins easier and more readable by adding features such as:
- Structs
- Better scoping
- Better control flow, including switch, return, break, and continue statements
- For loops
- Simplified memory management
- Enforcing variable declaration before use
- Nested functions
- Namespaces
- \+ more

# Usage
[REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) is required to run JSFX effects.
